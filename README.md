# xv6 Operating System
## Modified to run a Multi-Level Feedback Queue

This project was developed during the Opating Systems course at Portland State University. Over the course of 12 weeks, 
we took a basic version of the xv6 operating system, and modified it to run on an MLFQ. By doing this, we learned the process life cycle
of an operating system, as well as how the operating system has to handle processes in general.


#### Repository Format
This repository is formatted as assignment submissions. The term was split into 4 assignments, P1-P4, each one building on the last. 
The final submission, P4, is the implementation that has implemented an MLFQ.
